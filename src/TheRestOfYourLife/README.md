Ray Tracing: The Rest Of Your Life - Source
====================================================================================================

Content
--------
This folder contains the finished code for _Ray Tracing: The Rest Of Your Life_ ([local][] /
[online][]).


Intent
-------
This folder is not meant to act as its own tutorial. The source presented here is provided so you
can compare your work when progressing through the book. We strongly recommend reading and following
along with the book to understand the source.


Programming Language
---------------------
This book is written in C++, and uses some modern features of C++11. The language and features were
chosen to be broadly understood by the largest collection of programmers. It is not meant to
represent ideal C++ code.


Building
---------
As the source is intended for illustration & comparison only, it does not include any mechanism for
building a final program. As far as possible, the code is privately tested on multiple platforms to
ensure that it is generally usable on any OS (primarily Windows, OSX, and Linux), compiler, or build
environment.

It is therefore necessary for you to create your own build tooling. However, the source begins as a
single main file, and uses only a small collection of additional header files.

The _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series has a long history of implementations in other programming
languages (see [_Implementations in Other Languages_][implementations]), and across all three
primary operating systems. Feel free to add your own implementation to the list!
