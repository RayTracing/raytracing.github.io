# v3.1.0 (2020-05-03)

This minor upgrade adds some fixes and changes that are a bit more than just patches. The text now
has subchapter headings to help readers browse content and get a bit more context. We're introducing
new type aliases `point3` and `color` for `vec3` to better indicate the underlying mathematical
types of parameters and variables. Overall, a bunch of small improvements that we'd recommend
adopting, but may warrant comparison with any current projects.

  - Change: Books use Markdeep's image class=pixel for rendered image fidelity (#498)

### _In One Weekend_
  - Fix: Improve image size and aspect ratio calculation to make size changes easier
  - Fix: Added `t` parameter back into `hit_record` at correct place

    in rest of list.

  - Change: Default image sizes changed from 200x100 to 384x216
  - Change: First image size changed to 256x256

### _The Next Week_

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# v3.0.2 (2020-04-11)

# v3.0.0 (2020-03-23)

With the migration to a web format accomplished in v2.0.0, we immediately began work on a new major
release: v3.0.0. This release tackles the following key themes:

  - Establishing a common build system for the three projects. We chose CMake for its broad support
    for multiple platforms, as well as multiple build tools and IDEs. This change includes a
    reorganization of the project source files, and unifying a lot of code across projects.

  - A major upgrade of the project source code, addressing a number of large changes that we had
    deferred for later.

  - A number of larger changes to the book content, refining some approaches and ideas, and
    addressing some areas in the text that needed improvement.

Following this release, we expect to switch to a much more incremental approach, mostly with
patch-level (fix) changes and some minor-level (addition) changes.

### Common to All Project Source
