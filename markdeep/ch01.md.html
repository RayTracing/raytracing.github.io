Chapter 1: Output an image
Whenever you start a renderer, you need a way to see an image. The most straightforward way
is to write it to a file. The catch is, there are so many formats and many of those are complex. I
always start with a plain text ppm file. Here’s a nice description from Wikipedia:
Let’s make some C++ code to output such a thing:
There are some things to note in that code:
1. The pixels are written out in rows with pixels left to right.
2. The rows are written out from top to bottom.
3. By convention, each of the red/green/blue components range from 0.0 to 1.0. We will
relax that later when we internally use high dynamic range, but before output we will tone
map to the zero to one range, so this code won’t change.
4. Red goes from black to fully on from left to right, and green goes from black at the
bottom to fully on at the top. Red and green together make yellow so we should expect
the upper right corner to be yellow.
Opening the output file (in ToyViewer on my mac, but try it in your favorite viewer and google
“ppm viewer” if your viewer doesn’t support it) shows:
Hooray! This is the graphics “hello world”. If your image doesn’t look like that, open the output
file in a text editor and see what it looks like. It should start something like this:
If it doesn’t, then you probably just have some newlines or something similar that is confusing
the image reader.
If you want to produce more image types than PPM, I am a fan of ​stb_image.h​ available ​on
github​.
