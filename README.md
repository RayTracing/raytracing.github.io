Getting the Books
------------------
The _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series of books are now available to the public for free in PDF
form, along with the accompanying source code. Currently, we are also readying the first web release
of these books, for even easier access.

Releases are available [directly from GitHub][releases], or from Eric Haines's
[Real-Time Rendering][] site. Alternatively, you can purchase the Kindle version of this series from
Amazon.com ([in One Weekend][Amazon1], [The Next Week][Amazon2], [The Rest Of Your Life][Amazon3]).
Half of the proceeds of these sales go to [Hack the Hood][], a really neat organization.
