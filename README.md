Getting the Books
------------------
The _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series of books are now available to the public for free directly
from the web:

  - [Ray Tracing in One Weekend][web1]
  - [Ray Tracing: The Next Week][web2]
  - [Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life][web3]

These books have been formatted for both screen and print. For printed copies, or to create PDF
versions, use the print function in your browser.


Project Status
---------------
We just shipped a tiny release, [v3.2.3][], to get out two quick small fixes. Mostly we're very
heads-down right now working on our major v4 release. Lots of changes. If you'd like to check it
out, we're developing on the `dev-major` branch. We're tackling some larger refactorings to further
simplify the code, address some large outstanding issues, and focus on more development and
expansion of book 3: _Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life_.

If you have a change you'd like to contribute,
[please see our contribution guidelines][CONTRIBUTING].


GitHub Discussions
------------------
GitHub just released GitHub Discussions â€” a new feature to host conversations in a project without
requiring everything to be an issue. This is likely a much better way to post questions, ask for
advice, or just generally talk about the project. Is it useful? Don't know, but [let's give it a
shot!](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/discussions/).


Directory Structure
-------------------
The organization of this repository is meant to be simple and self-evident at a glance:

### books/
This folder contains the three raytracing books (in HTML), and some supporting material.

### images/
Contains all of the images and figures of the books. Can also be used to compare your results.

### style/
Contains the css for the books and the site.

### src/
Contains the source.

### src/common/
Contains any headers that are common to two or more books. This is also where external headers
are stored.

### src/`<book>`/
Contains the source specific to any one book. Their is no sharing of source outside of the common
directory.


Source Code
-----------
### Intent
This repository is not meant to act as its own tutorial. The source is provided so you can compare
your work when progressing through the book. We strongly recommend reading and following along with
the book to understand the source. Ideally, you'll be developing your own implmentation as you go,
in order to deeply understand how a raytracer works.

### Downloading The Source Code
The [GitHub home][] for this project contains all source and documentation associated with the _Ray
Tracing in One Weekend_ book series. To clone or download the source code, see the green "Clone or
download" button in the upper right of the project home page.

### Programming Language
This book is written in C++, and uses some modern features of C++11. The language and features were
chosen to be broadly understood by the largest collection of programmers. It is not meant to
represent ideal (or optimized) C++ code.

### Implementations in Other Languages
The _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series has a long history of implementations in other programming
languages (see [_Implementations in Other Languages_][implementations]), and across different
operating systems. Feel free to add your own implementation to the list!

### Branches
The `master` branch contains the latest released (and live) assets. All ongoing development, with
all of the latest changes, can be found in the `dev-patch`, `dev-minor`, and `dev-major` branches.
We try to keep CHANGELOG.md up to date, so you can easily browse what's new in each development
branch.


Building and Running
---------------------
Copies of source are provided for you to check your work and compare against. If you wish to build
the provided source, this project uses CMake. To build, go to the root of the project directory and
run the following commands to create the debug version of every executable:

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cmake --build build

You can specify the target with the `--target <program>` option, where the program may be
`inOneWeekend`, `theNextWeek`, `theRestOfYourLife`, or any of the demonstration programs. By default
(with no `--target` option), CMake will build all targets.

On Windows, you can build either `debug` (the default) or `release` (the optimized version). To
specify this, use the `--config <debug|release>` option.

### CMake GUI on Windows
You may choose to use the CMake GUI when building on windows.

1. Open CMake GUI on Windows
2. For "Where is the source code:", set to location of the copied directory. For example,
   `C:\Users\Peter\raytracing.github.io`.
3. Add the folder "build" within the location of the copied directory. For example,
   `C:\Users\Peter\raytracing.github.io\build`.
4. For "Where to build the binaries", set this to the newly-created build directory.
5. Click "Configure".
6. For "Specify the generator for this project", set this to your version of Visual Studio.
7. Click "Done".
8. Click "Configure" again.
9. Click "Generate".
10. In File Explorer, navigate to build directory and double click the newly-created `.sln` project.
11. Build in Visual Studio.

If the project is succesfully cloned and built, you can then use the native terminal of your
operating system to simply print the image to file.

### Running The Programs

On Linux or OSX, from the terminal, run like this:

    $ build/inOneWeekend > image.ppm

On Windows, run like this:

    build\debug\inOneWeekend > image.ppm

or, run the optimized version (if you've built with `--config release`):

    build\release\inOneWeekend > image.ppm

The generated PPM file can be viewed directly as a regular computer image, if your operating system
supports this image type. If your system doesn't handle PPM files, then you should be able to find
PPM file viewers online. We like [ImageMagick][].
